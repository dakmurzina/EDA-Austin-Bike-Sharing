# Austin Bike-Sharing Project


## Understanding the Impact of Bike Stations on Cleaner Transportation

The Austin Bike-Sharing Project is designed to evaluate the role and effectiveness of bike stations in Austin in promoting cleaner and sustainable transportation methods. Our analysis extends beyond general usage of bike stations and delves into temporal patterns, including peak usage times and variations among different stations. We will explore various factors such as popular commuter routes, bookings per station, trip durations, station activity, peak and off-peak usage, among others. Through this, we aim to provide comprehensive insights into the efficiency of Austin's bike-sharing infrastructure. Moreover, we hope to identify potential areas that could benefit from the implementation or enhancement of bike stations.

Throughout the project, we will perform rigorous data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, in-depth analysis, and data transformation. These steps will enable us to conduct detailed feature engineering for a deeper analysis of the collected data.


## Target Audience

Our report is intended to benefit a wide range of individuals and organizations, including: \
    - Environmental and sustainability organisations \
    - Bike advocacy groups \
    - Transportation authorities and officials \
    - Residents, community members, and the general public \
    - Travel agencies and tourists \
    - Students, researchers, and academics.
    
The report will be written at a moderate technical level, ensuring that the robust data analysis is paired with clear and accessible explanations, making it suitable for a diverse audience.

## Data Sources

For this project, we will utilize datasets collected from Google BigQuery, including: \
    - Bike Trip data: This dataset includes information on bike trips taken from December 2013 to March 2023. \
    - Bike Station data: This dataset provides information on all active and inactive bike stations in Austin. \
    - Weather Data Base - Visual Crossing (https://www.visualcrossing.com/). This dataset includes information on weather conditions taken from 01.01.2014 to 31.12.2015.

These datasets will enable us to understand the distribution and intensity of bike usage over time and across different stations, thereby playing a crucial role in answering our project question.

## Instructions

For the best experience and accurate results, it's essential to execute the code cells in the provided Jupyter notebook in the order they appear. As you work through this project, you may encounter the need to install additional Python libraries, such as Folium and Geopy, which are not included in the standard Python distribution.

To install these libraries, you can use the pip package manager, which is typically included with your Python installation. For instance, to install Folium, you would use the following command in your command line interface: *pip install folium* 

Please ensure these libraries are correctly installed before attempting to run the code cells that depend on them. This will ensure the smooth running of the program and the accuracy of the results.
